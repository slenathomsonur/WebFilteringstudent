# Simple Student Web Filter

A basic Python-based URL filtering tool inspired by Linewize, designed for educational purposes. This prototype checks URLs against predefined blocked categories (e.g., adult content, social media) and simulates allowing or blocking access. It is not production-ready but serves as a starting point for a student-safe web filter.

## Features
- Filters URLs based on keyword matching in predefined categories.
- Simulates blocking unsafe content with console output.
- Easy to extend with more categories or advanced filtering logic.
- Suitable for learning about content filtering concepts.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-student-web-filter.git
   cd simple-student-web-filter
